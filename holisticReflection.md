# Holistic Reflection

## Introduction
My journey in computer science began in high school and has become a passion of mine. Coming up on my graduation from the University of St. Thomas in the summer, I have grown. Not just technically, as a person and I learned the bigger picture of my purpose in developing software with the help of St. Thomas’s values. My educational path from Cretin-Derham Hall through St. Thomas has shaped my perspective, particularly the university's emphasis on creating technology that serves humanity. This reflection made me who I am today as a computer scientist, as shown in my senior capstone project, EZDocs—an AI-assisted text editor designed to help beginners in IT and software development write comprehensive documentation. I chose to do this project because it was something that I found myself struggling with in my first job working in IT.

## Growth and Development
At first in high school, I experienced coding at the basic level, starting with coding languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS at a basic level. St. Thomas then introduced me to the more advanced concepts of those languages and taught me different languages as well, like MIPS, bash, and C. This provided the foundation for tackling more difficult projects. However, it was the creation of EZDocs alongside my teammates Anton Lacson and Alex Cole that jump-started my growth in applying these skills to solve real-world problems. This project taught me how to operate with others and allowed us to develop our own product of our choosing.
My primary contribution to EZDocs focused on frontend design and UI/UX development. This responsibility perfectly aligned with my passion for creating accessibility-focused applications that are intuitive for the user. When I first began studying computer science, I viewed user interfaces very surface level. Did not keep in mind the thought that goes into creating a seamless design for the user. Through my last semester’s course in Human-Computer Interaction, it opened my mind to the practice of creating a practically designed website. Through tools like Figma, I came to understand that thoughtful interface design is fundamental to technology adoption and accessibility.

## Challenges
The challenges I faced while developing the EZDocs interface were substantial. I needed to create a design system that would be intuitive for beginners while still offering the functionality needed for comprehensive documentation. I also had to work in a SCRUM, which was a new concept to me. All the aspects of my role were crucial to the success in the creation of EZDocs.
My interests in cybersecurity have similarly evolved. What began with information security in the fall of 2024. Cybersecurity is something that I have a keen interest in and learning from the EZDocs system and how it stores users’ information increased my knowledge. Cybersecurity is something that will be important in EZDocs’ future to keep confidential documents secure and security is something users care about. Implementing more security options will be crucial in the continuation of EZDocs. 
Another significant challenge I had was designing the template selection and customization process. I started from a simple design with small boxes that contained the templates on the create page. This design, however, was not very usable. It was confusing to find documents, and once we increased the amount, it would become very difficult to find a template. Using feedback from the demo was helpful. I was given a good critique that helped me build a user path, split the templates into categories (IT and Software Development were chosen), and have a user path that filtered the templates from there. This concept of creating a user path opened my mind and helped me face the challenge of creating an easy-to-use UI. 

## Allignment with My Values
EZDocs aligns with my technical achievements and personal values that I have gained throughout my time at St. Thomas. In my portfolio, I state that I am "passionate about helping people use software and technology by creating easy-to-use interfaces and incorporating accessible features for everyone." This project directly shows that passion, allowing me to apply my UI/UX skills to make technical documentation more approachable.
Additionally, I was able to learn more about documentation entirely. During the creation of EZDocs, I was tasked with doing research on documentation and creating the templates. This was perfect for me because I was learning about different documentation and discovered templates that could aid me in my future, like the Arc42 Software Documentation template. This is something that will directly align with my future as a computer scientist. 

## Conclusion
My experience with EZDocs has shaped my vision for continued professional growth as I approach graduation in 2025. I plan to deepen my understanding of frontend design with accessibility standards, as I've seen firsthand how thoughtful design can make complex tasks more approachable. For the future, I also want to enhance my knowledge in cybersecurity, as I think it is a prosperous field to step into. Regarding EZDocs, it would be amazing to continue building, but for now, the project will be on hold until further notice. 
The development of EZDocs alongside Anton and Alex has taught me many things. How documentation is created, working with AI, working in a SCRUM, and most importantly, creating a user-centered front-end design. As I move forward in my career in IT and Cybersecurity, keeping what I learned through this course in mind will benefit me exponentially. Not only will this course help me, but the University of St. Thomas’ values that I was taught throughout my four years here will also guide me into the workplace. I now feel ready to enter the workplace and take up professional IT roles that I aspire to accomplish in my life. I would like to thank all the professors and friends who helped me along my way, and I hope to keep getting better in this profession using their help.
